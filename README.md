Certainly! Here's a complete README.md file for your reactive microservice:

# Reactive User Account and Transaction Service

This is a reactive microservice built using Spring WebFlux, JDK 17, Docker, and PostgreSQL. It provides APIs to manage user accounts and transactions.

## Requirements

To run this microservice locally, you need to have the following installed:

- JDK 17
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/reactive-transaction-service.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd reactive-transaction-service
   ```

3. Start the application and PostgreSQL using Docker Compose:

   ```shell
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command will start the application and PostgreSQL database in the background using the configuration defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file located in the project root directory.

4. Access the application:

   The microservice will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`. You can use tools like cURL or Postman to interact with the provided API endpoints.

## API Endpoints

### Get all user accounts

- `GET /users`

  Retrieves all user accounts.

### Get all transactions for a user

- `GET /users/{userId}/transactions`

  Retrieves all transactions for the specified `userId`.

### Create a transaction for a user

- `POST /users/{userId}/transactions`

  Creates a new transaction for the specified `userId`.

### Get a specific transaction for a user

- `GET /users/{userId}/transactions/{transId}`

  Retrieves a specific transaction with the given `transId` for the specified `userId`.

### Get a user account by ID

- `GET /users/{id}`

  Retrieves a user account with the specified `id`.

### Delete a user account

- `DELETE /users/{id}`

  Deletes a user account with the specified `id`.

### Create a new user account

- `POST /users`

  Creates a new user account.

### Update a user account

- `PUT /users/{id}`

  Updates an existing user account with the specified `id`.

## Database Configuration

The microservice uses a PostgreSQL database for data storage. The database configuration is defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file, which creates a PostgreSQL container and sets up the necessary environment variables.

By default, the PostgreSQL container is configured with the following settings:

- Database name: `transaction_db`
- Username: `your-username`
- Password: `your-password`

You can modify these values in the `docker-compose.yaml` file as per your requirements.

## Additional Information

Here are some additional details about the microservice:

- The `UserController` class is the main REST controller responsible for handling the API requests and delegating to the appropriate service classes.
- The `UserAccountService` class provides methods to manage user accounts, such as retrieving all accounts, finding an account by ID, creating a new account, updating an existing account, and deleting an account.
- The `UserTransactionService` class provides methods to manage user transactions, such as retrieving all transactions for a user, creating a new transaction, and retrieving a specific transaction by ID for a user.
- The `UserAccountDto` and `UserTransactionDto` classes are DTO (Data Transfer Object) classes used for transferring data between the client and the server.
- The microservice uses the reactive programming model with Spring WebFlux, allowing for non-blocking and efficient handling of concurrent requests.
